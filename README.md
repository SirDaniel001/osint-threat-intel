# OSINT Threat Intelligence Platform

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a **30-day challenge** to build a professional-grade OSINT-based Threat Intelligence Platform. The platform focuses on detecting phishing domains, monitoring dark web sources, and generating real-time alerts for threats targeting financial institutions in Kenya, including the Central Bank of Kenya and related services (e.g., M-PESA).

---

## âœ… Objectives
- Detect **phishing domains** targeting financial entities.
- Monitor **surface web** and **dark web forums** for malicious activity.
- Collect, enrich, and correlate threat intelligence data.
- Provide **real-time alerts** and a **visual dashboard** for analysts.

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Flask, FastAPI)
- **Database:** SQLite / PostgreSQL
- **OSINT Tools & APIs:** Shodan, PhishTank, AbuseIPDB, WHOIS, Dark Web Crawler
- **Visualization:** Chart.js, Flask Templates
- **Deployment:** Linux (Kali)

## âœ… How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/osint-threat-intel.git
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add your API keys in `config/.env`:
   ```
   SHODAN_API_KEY=your_key
   ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=your_key
   ```
4. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
